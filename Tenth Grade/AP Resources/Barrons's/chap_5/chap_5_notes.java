/* The Software Development Life Cycle */

// The Waterfall Model
The waterfall model of software development brings structure and efficiency into the process of creating programs. Each step in the process flows into the next:
Analysis of the Specification ---
								|
								Program Design ---
												 |
												 Implementation ---
												 				  |
												 				  Testing & Debugging ---
												 				  						|
												 				  						Maintenance

// Program Specification
The spec is a written description of the program based on a customer''s requirements. The first step in a project is to understand the spec.

// Program Design
Good design saves programming time and enhance the reliability of the final program. The design is usually a fairly detailed plan.

// Program Implementation
Program implementation is actually writing the code.

// Testing and Debugging
A set of test data should be selected since every possible input cannot be tested. Typical values, as well as endpoints and out of range value should be tested.

// Types of Errors
A compile-time error occurs during compilation of the program.
A run-time error occurs during execution of the program.
The intent or logic error is one that runs properly but fails to carry out the spec.

// Robustness
Always assume that your program is dumber than you. You have to try to write a program that
 - Won''t give inaccurate answers for some input data
 - Won''t crash if the input data are invalid
 - Won''t allow execution to proceed if invalid data are entered

// Program Maintenance
Maintenance is upgrading the code as the circumstances change, e.g., new features are added, new programmers are working on the program.
